      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <div class="multi-col">
        <p>This website was created to explain the concept of value-based care (VBC) and its growing impact on modern healthcare systems. It offers a clear overview of how VBC shifts incentives from quantity to quality, focusing on prevention, coordination, and long-term patient well-being.</p>

        <p>Across countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, healthcare spending continues to rise, yet outcomes remain uneven. By examining both systems, this project aims to highlight the shared challenges—aging populations, chronic illnesses, and resource disparities—and the ways VBC frameworks can address them through innovation and equity.</p>

      <h3>Design and Approach</h3>
      <div class="multi-col">
        <p>The design of this site reflects the principles of clarity and accessibility. Using a clean grid-based layout, readable typography, and responsive design, it ensures usability across all devices. Each section emphasizes ease of navigation and visual balance, aligning with the idea that effective healthcare communication should be transparent, inclusive, and data-driven.</p>

        <p>The visuals and structure are inspired by healthcare’s goal of integration—bridging research, policy, and practice. Through concise summaries and visual examples, this project provides an educational resource that brings complex policy ideas into accessible language and design.</p>
